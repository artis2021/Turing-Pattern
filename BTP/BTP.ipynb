    "# Turing Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1952, [Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) published a paper called [\"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\"](http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf) suggesting a possible mechanism for how a simple set of chemical reactions could lead to the formation of stripes, spots and other patterns we see on animals. It is a surprisingly readable paper that covers some maths, some chemistry, some numerical modelling and ties it all together to try and answer a biological question. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of the paper are a set of partial differential equations known as [reaction-diffusion equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system). Turing's analysis shows that in certain regimes systems that obey these equations are unstable to small perturbations, leading to the growth of large scale patterns.\n",

    "## Stability Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to the original equations. We've seen that for certain conditions, pattern formations occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, solving the equations directly for non-linear reaction functions is often not possible. Instead we can look at what happens when the the system is perturbed slightly from equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linearising the Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by assuming there is some concentrations, $a_{0}$ and $b_{0}$, for which the system is stable. This means that \n",
    " - $R_{a}(a_{0},b_{0}) = 0$\n",
    " - $R_{b}(a_{0},b_{0}) = 0$\n",
    " \n",
    "Around these solutions, we look at the time dependence of small perturbations around these values\n",
    " - $x = a - a_{0}$\n",
    " - $y = b - b_{0}$\n",
    " \n",
    "And linearise the reaction equations\n",
    " - $R_{a}(a,b) \\approx r_{aa}x + r_{ab}y$\n",
    " - $R_{b}(a,b) \\approx r_{ba}x + r_{bb}y$\n",
    " \n",
    "where $r_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial R_{i}}{\\partial j}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These approximations give us a set of linear equations, written in vector form as\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = D\\nabla^{2} \\mathbf{x} + R \\mathbf{x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $R = \\left(\\begin{matrix} r_{11} & r_{12} \\\\ r_{21} & r_{22}\\end{matrix}\\right)$ and $D = \\left(\\begin{matrix} D_{a} & 0 \\\\ 0 & D_{b}\\end{matrix}\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fourier Transform\n",
    "If we impose periodic boundary conditions to this equation, a natural solution can be found by applying a [Fourier Transformation](https://acko.net/files/gltalks/toolsforthought/) to $\\mathbf{x}$. If we call the reciprocal coordinate $k$, and the Fourier transform of $\\mathbf{x}$ as $\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}$, then the transformed equation is \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}} = (R - k^{2}D) \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which, has solutions of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}(t) = \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}(0) e^{\\omega t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find $\\omega$ we plug this solution back into our transformed equation to get\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\omega \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}} = (R - k^{2}D) \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Showing that $\\omega$ is just the eigenvalue of $(R - k^{2}D)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have an equation for the time dependence of our system in the Fourier domain. Using it, we can now discuss what we mean by _stability_. Our system is considered stable if small perturbations around the homogeneous do not cause it to move further away from the stable solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of our solution, $\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}(0) e^{\\omega t}$, stability means that the values of $\\omega$ does not have positive real parts for all values of $k$. If $\\omega$ is negative, the perturbation will decay away. If $\\omega$ is imaginary, it will oscillate around the stable state. However, if it is positive and real _any_ small perturbation will grow exponentially, until a high order term of the reaction equation becomes important.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find $\\omega$, we need to solve the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hbox{Det}(R - k^{2}D - \\omega I) = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing $J = R - k^{2}D$, this equitation takes the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\omega^{2} - \\omega\\hbox{Tr}(J) + \\hbox{Det}(J) = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $\\omega$, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\omega = \\frac{1}{2}(\\hbox{Tr}(J) \\pm \\sqrt{\\hbox{Tr}(J)^{2} - 4 \\hbox{Det}(J) })$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditions for (in)Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "From our initial assumption that there was a stable homogeneous state, we require that $\\omega$ has negative real parts where $k = 0$, which corresponds to the spatially homogeneous solution. For this to be true, we require that \n",
    "\n",
    " - $\\hbox{Tr}(R) < 0$\n",
    " - $\\hbox{det}(R) > 0$\n",
    " \n",
    "Or, in terms of the components of $R$:\n",
    " - $r_{aa} + r_{bb} < 0$\n",
    " - $r_{aa}r_{bb} - r_{ab}r_{ba} > 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "For an instability to now occur at finite wavelength, we need one of the following conditions to hold:\n",
    " - $\\hbox{Tr}(J) > 0$\n",
    " - $\\hbox{det}(J) < 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $\\hbox{Tr}(J) = \\hbox{Tr}(R) - k^{2}(d_{a} + d_{b})$, the first condition cannot hold for any real $k$. This means the we require the second to hold, or, after a bit of algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "$k^{4}d_{a}d_{b} - k^{2}(d_{a}r_{bb} + d_{b}r_{aa}) + (r_{aa}r_{bb} - r_{ab}r_{ba}) < 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some real value of $k$. Once again, we need to solve a quadratic equation. To do this we note that because $k$ needs to be real, $k^{2}$ must be positive. This means that at least one root of quadratic equation in $k^{2}$ needs to be positive and real. This condition is only met when \n",
    "\n",
    "$d_{b}r_{aa} + d_{a}r_{bb} > 2\\sqrt{d_{a}d_{b}(r_{aa}r_{bb} - r_{ab}r_{ba})} > 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it. We've derived that conditions for the diffusion-reaction equations to be stable to small perturbations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can write the complete requirements as\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $r_{aa} + r_{bb} < 0$\n",
    "2. $r_{aa}r_{bb} - r_{ab}r_{ba} > 0$\n",
    "3. $d_{b}r_{aa} + d_{a}r_{bb} > 2\\sqrt{d_{a}d_{b}(r_{aa}r_{bb} - r_{ab}r_{ba})} > 0$"

    "### Discussion\n",
    "We've waded through a lot of maths to reach this point. Let's take stock of what we can make of the conditions for instability that we have derived. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the diffusion coefficients are positive, from the first and third equation above, we know that $r_{aa}$ and $r_{bb}$ have to have different signs, and the component with the negative sign has to be larger. Combining this we the second equation we know that either $r_{ab}$ or $r_{ba}$ has to be negative, and the other has to be positive. This two facts show why some systems like this are called activator-inhibitor system: the presence of one component increase the production of itself - the other inhibits the production of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information, the third equation shows us that the diffusion coefficients need to be different. Specifically, the diffusion coefficient of the inhibitor has to be larger then that of the activator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, this gives us a hand-waving explanation of what might be going on: Consider starting with a small increase in the activator at some point. This in turn creates an increase in the inhibitor at that point. Both of these chemical diffuse to nearby points, but the inhibitor diffuses faster, lowering the activator concentration of nearby points. This lowering of the activator concentration at nearby points, which in turn lowers the inhibitor concentration. The disturbance spreads out like a wave. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a lot easier to get a feel for what's going on once we visualise the this perturbation:"

    "It is interesting to ask how the parameters of the equations affect the pattern formation. To get a feel for what this dependence is, we can investigate the amplitude of the instability for different frequencies. Close to equilibrium, we expect the frequency with the largest real component to dominate the dynamics of the system.\n",

    "Calculating this value isn't mathematically difficult: we have an equation of the amplitude $\\omega$ in terms of the frequency $k$ above. Differentiating an equation of this size by hand can become tedious due to its size, and it is easy to introduce errors. And why carry out simple replacement steps when we have a computer to hand?\n",

    "Turing patterns are only one part of pattern generation from non-linear PDEs. Given we have the tools to explore these systems, it is worth looking at another simple system in which pattern formation occurs: [the Gray-Scott equations](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/amorphous/GrayScott/). As described in the paper [Complex Patterns in a Simple System](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~frank011/Classes/complexity/Literature/Pearson.pdf), for an interesting set of initial conditions the Gray-Scott equations result in a range complex patterns being formed. \n",
    "\n",
    "While these equations _are_ reaction-diffusion equations, the patterns that end up being formed are not from Turing instabilities. Instead they come from the initial conditions of the system: a small region in the centre of the region is perturbed. As this perturbation spreads out, strange patterns are formed. \n",
    "\n",
    "To visualise it, we just need to pass another initialisation function of our previous class, and put in new reaction equations. The parameters for the interesting systems are taken from [here](http://www.aliensaint.com/uo/java/rd/). I'm not currently aware of any theory that gives a full explanation of these patterns. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "It's been interesting to play with these non-linear systems. One of the main challenges I've found with looking at them is how you find \"interesting\" parameters. I have some ideas about how we might search for these automatically, but that will have to wait for another post. \n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity that can arise from these simple systems surprised me at fist, but it [has been shown](http://schulmanlab.jhu.edu/papers/reaction-diffusion-ca-journal-version.pdf) that it is possible to encode cellular automata in reaction diffusion systems. This suggests that the patterns formed by reaction-diffusion systems can be as complex as those produced by any Turing-complete system, and that any attempt to provide a quantitative explanation for their full behaviour will eventually run into some undecidable statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "And with that connection between Turing's work on reaction-diffusion equations and his more well known work on computability, I think it's time to end this post.\n"
